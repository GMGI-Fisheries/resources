# Introduction to Containers

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

Two popular container engines: [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/introduction.html)

Both work very similarly but Singularity is specifically designed for HPC systems.

A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers â€“ images become containers when they run on a container engine.
