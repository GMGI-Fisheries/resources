_Flowchart of possible operations by methylKit. A summary of the most importantmethylKit features is shown in a flow chart. It depicts the main features of methylKitand the sequential relationship between them. The functions that could be used for thosefeatures are also printed in the boxes._ - Figure and caption from [Akalin et al. 2012](https://doi.org/10.1186/gb-2012-13-10-r87)
