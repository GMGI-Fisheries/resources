This script takes your Blast output from the GMGI database, Mitofish database, and NCBI database to create one datatable with read counts and taxonomic assignment.  

**Workflow summary:**  
1. Load libraries  
2. Load metadata   
3. Load BLAST output from GMGI, Mitofish, and NCBI   
4. Load DADA2 ASV Table   
5. Taxonomic Assignment
- 5a. Identify ASVs with multiple hits from GMGI's database  
- 5b. Identify entries that mismatch between GMGI, Mitofish, and NCBI databases  
- 5c. Assign taxonomy based on hierarchical approach  
- 5d. Edit taxonomy annotations based on mismatch table choices  
- 5e. Adjusting common name and category for those entries that don't have one (from Mito or NCBI)  
6. Filtering: Filter ASV by less than 0.1% reads and then collapse by group  
7. Collapsing read counts by species name  
8. Creating results output 


# Load libraries

```{r}
library(ggplot2) ## for plotting
library(dplyr) ## for data table manipulation
library(tidyr) ## for data table manipulation
library(readr) ## for reading in tsv files

# Metadata input

## Identify paths for metadata and project data 

Each user needs to write in their specific directory outputs prior to the file name. The default working directory is this document so the folder where this script is saved for the user. To change the workign directory to the Rproject directory, select 'Knit' and 'Knit Directory' > 'Project Directory'.

```{r}

### User edits:
### 1. change path of metadata file

## EXCEL

## CSV 
meta <- read.csv("example_input/metadata.csv", header = TRUE)
```

## Load database metadata

No user edits in this section because paths have already been set above.

```{r}
# Load GMGI database information (common name, species name, etc.)
gmgi_db <- read_xlsx(path_GMGIdb, sheet = 1) %>% dplyr::rename(sseqid = Ref) %>%
  ## removing > from beginning of entires within Ref column
  mutate(sseqid = gsub(">", "", sseqid))
```

# BLAST data input

```{r}
Blast_GMGI <- read.table(path_blast_gmgi, header=F, col.names = blast_col_headers, colClasses = blast_col_classes) %>%
  ## blast changes spaces to hyphons so we need to change that back to match our metadata
  mutate(sseqid = gsub("-", " ", sseqid)) %>%
  ## join with GMGI database information

  # renaming sseqid to species name
  dplyr::rename(Species_name = sseqid) %>%
  
  # replacing _ with spaces
  mutate(Species_name = gsub("_", " ", Species_name))
```


## NCBI database 

No user edits.

```{r}
NCBI_taxassigned <- read.delim2(path_blast_ncbi_taxassigned, header=F, col.names = c("staxid", "Phylo")) %>%
  ## creating taxonomic assignment columns
  separate(Phylo, c("Kingdom", "Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Genus", "Species_name"), sep = ";") %>%
  ## creating species column based on Species_name
  mutate(., species = str_after_nth(Species_name, " ", 1))

Blast_NCBI <- read.table(path_blast_ncbi, header=F,
                           col.names = c("ASV_ID", "sseqid", "sscinames", "staxid", "pident", "length", "mismatch",
                                         "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore"),
                           colClasses = c(rep("character", 3), "integer", rep("numeric", 9))) %>%
  left_join(., NCBI_taxassigned, by = "staxid")
```


# Load DADA2 ASV Table 

The column headers will be the Sample IDs and the first column is the ASV ID. ASVs are given a "rank" based on sum of reads from that ASV (pre-filtering). 'Random' indicates that if ASVs are tied, then the code will randomly assign a rank for those tied. Because we don't need an exact rank here, 'random' will do for a tie-breaker.

No user edits.

```{r}
ASV_table <- read_tsv(path_asv_table, show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  ## calculate the sum of all reads for each ASV
  mutate(., ASV_sum = rowSums(across(where(is.numeric)))) %>% 
  
  ## calculate a ranking based on those sum calculated above
  mutate(ASV_rank = rank(-ASV_sum, ties.method='random')) %>%
  
  ## move the sum and rank columns to after ASV_ID and arrange by rank
  relocate(c(ASV_sum,ASV_rank), .after = ASV_ID) %>% arrange((ASV_rank))

## creating list of rankings
ASV_rank_list <- ASV_table %>% dplyr::select(ASV_ID, ASV_sum, ASV_rank)
```

# Taxonomic Assignment

Identifying where NCBI, Mito, and GMGI disagree on tax assignment. With the hierarchial approach, ASVs that match to GMGI and several other databases will only result in GMGI assignment. By reviewing this df, we can be sure we aren't missing an assignment in our GMGI curated database. 

**Sub-workflow:**  
1. Identify any ASVs that contain multiple hits within the GMGI database.
2. Identify entries that mismatch between GMGI, Mitofish, and NCBI databases.
3. Assign taxonomy based on hierarchical approach.
4. Edit taxonomy annotations based on mismatch table.  
5. Adjusting common name for those entries that don't have one (from Mito or GMGI). 

## Identify any ASVs that contain multiple hits within the GMGI database

At this point, a fisheries team member needs to make choices about which taxonomic assignment to accept.

#### Create list of those ASVs with multiple hits

No user edits.

```{r}
multiple_hit_choice <- Blast_GMGI %>% group_by(ASV_ID) %>%
  ## take top percent identity hit, count the number of top hits, and filter to those with more than 1 top hit 
  slice_max(pident, n=1) %>% count() %>% filter(n>1) %>%
  
  ## adding BLAST_GMGI information with these ASVs and ASV rank and sum
  left_join(., Blast_GMGI, by = "ASV_ID") %>%
  left_join(., ASV_rank_list, by = "ASV_ID") %>%
  
  ## moving database percent ID to be next to Blast percent ID
  relocate(c(db_percent_ID, ASV_sum, ASV_rank), .after = pident) %>%
  
  ## adding choice column for next steps 
  mutate(Choice = NA)

## export this data frame as excel sheet 
multiple_hit_choice %>% write_xlsx(path_choice_required)
```

Based on the output above, user needs to make some choices. In the excel spreadsheet, user needs to mark 'x' on the choices desired while leaving the other entries blank. 

#### Choosing one of several hits. 

Load choice edited dataset. No user edits. 

```{r}
multiple_hit_choice_edited <- read_xlsx("example_output/Taxonomic_assignments/Choice_required_GMGI_multiplehits_edited.xlsx") %>%
  ## selecting the choices made
  filter(!is.na(Choice)) %>%
  ## selecting only columns needed 
  dplyr::select(ASV_ID, sseqid, Choice)
```

A for loop will filter Blast_GMGI df based on these choices. No user edits. 

```{r}
# Create a new edited df
Blast_GMGI_edited <- Blast_GMGI 

# Loop through each row of the dataframe
for (i in multiple_hit_choice_edited$ASV_ID) {
  # Extract the current row (will do this for each ASV_ID in the choice df)
  current_row <- multiple_hit_choice_edited %>% subset(ASV_ID==i)
  
  # Apply filter based on the current row's condition
  Blast_GMGI_edited <- Blast_GMGI_edited %>%
    filter(case_when(ASV_ID == current_row$ASV_ID ~ sseqid == current_row$sseqid,
           TRUE ~ TRUE))
}
```

#### Confirming that all entries have been dealth with

No user edits.

```{r}
### Check the below output to confirm the filtering steps above worked (if it worked, it won't be in output)
Blast_GMGI_edited %>% group_by(ASV_ID) %>% slice_max(pident, n=1) %>% count() %>% filter(n>1)
```


## Identify entries that mismatch between GMGI, Mitofish, and NCBI databases

  full_join(Blast_NCBI %>% dplyr::select(ASV_ID, Species_name) %>%
              dplyr::rename(NCBI = Species_name) %>%
              distinct() %>% group_by(ASV_ID) %>%
              mutate(NCBI = paste0(NCBI, collapse = ";")),
            by = "ASV_ID") %>%
  
  ## adding ASV rank and sum information
  left_join(., ASV_rank_list, by = "ASV_ID") %>%

  ## filtering out duplicate rows
  distinct() %>%

  filter((GMGI_100 != GMGI_lessthan100 | GMGI_100 != Mitofish | GMGI_100 != NCBI | is.na(GMGI_100))) %>%
  
  ## adding choice column for next steps 
  mutate(Choice = NA)

## export this data frame as excel sheet 
Disagree %>% write_xlsx(path_disagree_list)
```

## Assign taxonomy based on hierarchical approach

Taxonomic identification is taken from GMGI 100%, then GMGI <100%, then Mitofish 100%, and finally NCBI 100%.
