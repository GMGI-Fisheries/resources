# SAFS Purchasing

## General Purchasing

Here is the procedure for purchases. Generally, we are shifting to have SAFS admin staff handling purchasing as default (SAFS Purchasing Form).

1.  Submit initial request in [`#purchasing` channel on Slack](https://genefish.slack.com/messages/CDPNUMPFC/).

    a.  Provide link(s) to desired product(s)

    -   University of Washington preferred vendors should always be given priority (i.e. don't default to buying from Amazon.com)

    b.  Purchasing approval will be confirmed by Steven and he will provide the appropriate budget number & name to use

2.  Sumbit Purchase

    There are three basic means by which to submit a purchase. They are listed in order (top to bottom) of preferred usage:

    -   [treq](https://treq.environment.uw.edu)

    -   [eProcurement (Ariba)](https://ar.admin.washington.edu/AribaBuyer/uw/login.asp)

        -   Requires pre-authorization from Steven and the department to use. Instructions, training, and tutorials are available from [UW Procurement Services](http://finance.uw.edu/ps/).

    -   [ProCard](https://finance.uw.edu/ps/how-to-buy/procurement-card)

        -   ProCard is a credit card issued to specific users via the University of Washington.

        -   Graduate students are not elligible for ProCard use.

        -   Sam is the only current lab member who has a ProCard.

        -   Obtaining a ProCard requires completing a [University of Washington training course](http://f2.washington.edu/fm/ps/upcoming-events).

        -   ProCards cannot be used for travel or meal expenses.

3.  Fill out [Roberts Lab Purchasing Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHXiiEzWhh0XHnEMvKz4TX10e69ErOWHv5Jo-ouk6x8/edit?usp=sharing)

    -   Spreadsheet is organized by date ordered.

    -   Each row represents an order submitted to a single vendor; list all items, quantities, and catalogue numbers in a single cell for a given order.

4.  Receiving Orders

    1.  Compare contents of box(es) and compare to packing slips.

    2.  Sign and date all packing slips.

    -   If no packing slip is provided, email Lisa Smith indicating the vendor and date the items were received.

    3.  Put packing slips in designated main office inbox (FSH 116).

    4.  Indicate date order was received in [Roberts Lab Purchasing Log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHXiiEzWhh0XHnEMvKz4TX10e69ErOWHv5Jo-ouk6x8/edit?usp=sharing)

    5.

## Travel and Meeting Registration

*Note Steps 1 and 2 need to occur prior to travel*

Travel is handled via <https://treq.environment.uw.edu>

Step 1) Need to identify and apply for any supplemental support. This includes at the School and College level. This also includes support offered by the conference itself. Many conferences have early-bird rates and discounted hotels. These should be considered.
Note: 
-   [The College of the Environment travel fund](https://environment.uw.edu/students/current-students/scholarships-funding/travel-fund/) is only for future travel so make sure you apply for this two quarters in advance if possible.
-   FINS travel funds are prioritized for those involved in FINS or some other type of service related to SAFS (CoEnv SAC, SEAS, GSS, etc.).

Step 2) For any travel you need to complete Travel Pre-Authorization as soon as you know you would like to travel. (_It is optional to complete for local transit to research sites_)

![treq](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RobertsLab/resources/master/img/treq-pre.png)

During the Pre-Authorization step you can request a per diem Advance. But if your projected per diem for the length of travel is not $300 or more, you *are not* eligible for per diem advance.

**Note that there are options to have UW directly pay for conference registration, if you can get an invoice from the conference** When this is the case you would simply submit this invoice for payment with the "Pay an Invoice" option in Treq and not include in Travel Authorization / Reimbursement. Make sure you upload your invoice to the OneDrive folder associated with your request.

Step 3) Secure transit and lodging following all [rules and regulations set forth by UW](https://finance.uw.edu/travel/policies). 

**In order to have UW pay directly for your flight and lodging, you must follow these steps.** Once you have completed your travel pre-authorization, click on the "+Task" button on the main page of your travel request. Leave "Assign To" blank and fill in "Task Title" with something like "UW direct payment". Fill in the description with the parts of your travel request you would like to get UW to pay for directly. For example: "Could I get UW to directly pay for airfare and lodging so I don't have to use personal card?". Save the task. Someone from UW will be assigned to the task and will reach out with further instructions to reserve your flight and/or reserve lodging. For flights, you will be contacted via email by Tangerine Travel Agency. You'll need to provide them with the exact flight itinerary you want so they can book your flight.

Step 4) When travel is complete, submit required documentation via Treq

If you need technical assistance you can email efast\@uw.edu.
