All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

In our lab we:

- Recognize our differences as strengths

- Promote continuing education in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). See [non-exhaustive list of DEI resources offered by UW and beyond](DEI-Resources.md)

- Provide educational and emotional support for each other

- Provide resources for educational and emotional support

- Provide resources for personal and professional growth



Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

We do not tolerate harassment and/or discrimination of lab members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions (however, do note that we work on biological matters so work-related discussions of e.g. animal reproduction are appropriate).

We expect members to follow these guidelines at any lab-related event.

If you have experienced harassment, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Steven Roberts  (SAFS Graduate Program Coordinator and PI) or Amy Fox (SAFS Graduate Program Adviser) immediately.


### *Code of Conduct for DEI Meetings*

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background, identity, physical appearance, or manner of communication. Any form of language or behavior used to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort will not be tolerated. This applies to all course participants (instructor, students, guests). In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment, we will be using progressive stack discussion methods and these discussion rules:

*Discussion Rules*

1.  We will listen with the intent to understand.
2.  We will monitor our own air time, aiming to share the space and time so others may participate as well.
3.  We will respect those who do not wish to speak.
4.  We will use "I" statements as opposed to generalizations.
5.  We will not ask anyone to speak on behalf of any group we perceive them to identify with, or that they self-identify with.
6.  We will expect discomfort.
7.  We will resist the urge to "fix" others' discomfort.
8.  We will elevate impact above intent, and we will apologize when necessary.
9.  We will expect and accept non-closure. We acknowledge that these conversations may not be resolved in a single meeting.
10. We will take lessons learned, but not others' stories, out of this space.
11. We will not participate in ad hominem attacks.
