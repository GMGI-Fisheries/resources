There are a variety of hardware and software options and combinations available to you. While there are few concrete rules, here is an attempt to guide your success.


Resources for thinking about open and reproducible scientific computing.


## Practical Aspects

Formost, code should be written so someone else could easily run. This means they have access and can understand.

1) Code should be in a Github repository 

2) [Organize](https://kbroman.org/steps2rr/pages/organize.html) your data and code.
