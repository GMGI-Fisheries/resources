Protocols for benchwork in the lab (e.g. RNA isolation), for commonly used instruments and software (e.g. proteomics data analysis in Skyline), and for commonly performed hatchery practices and tissue sampling.

Foundational protocols can be found [here](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/tree/master/protocols). As they become prominent, they will be migrated here for posterity.

## RNA Extraction 
  We often use MRC RNA-zol RT ([protocol](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/blob/master/protocols/Commercial_Protocols/MRC_RNAzol-RT-march-2017.pdf)). Depending on downstream needs we might engage in DNAase treatment.
