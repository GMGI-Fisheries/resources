The first step for being added to the Roberts Lab account is to [submit an issue requesting access](https://github.com/RobertsLab/resources/issues/new). Once you have been added into the UW-IT system (you will notified by a response in the GitHub issue), you can follow the steps below.

For two factor authentication, you can either sign up for Duo [here](https://identity.uw.edu/2fa/) and use your smart phone or request a security token [here](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/service/authentication/). Duo is much easier.
