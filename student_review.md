# Graduate Student & Advisor Annual Review   

School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences

# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of these form (3) is to provide guidelines for annual meetings between graduate students and their academic advisors, and to harmonize the system across different faculty. The first two forms (Student & Advisor Annual Review) mainly serve to facilitate communication between student and advisor and can be adjusted to the needs of specific research groups. They should be made available to the student's committee for its annual meeting and kept on file by the advisor of the student. The third and final form is filled in by the committee and will be included in the student&#39;s file held at SAFS.

These **annual** check-ins should consist of three steps:

1. Independent reports  
  - Student and Advisor both complete Annual Reports independently, then exchange  
2. Student / Advisor meeting
  - Meet to discuss independent reports  
  - Define specific goals for the next academic year  
  - After meeting, distribute both reports to Committee  
3. Committee meeting 
  - Meet to discuss independent reports  
  - Revise and/or approve goals for next academic year 
  - Commitee discusses and completes Annual Committee Meeting Report, and sends to Student for response.  
  - Advisor files completed Committee Report with SAFS.
