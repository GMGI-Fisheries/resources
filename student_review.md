# Graduate Student Annual Academic Review

School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences

# Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this form is to provide guidelines for annual review meetings with graduate students, and to harmonize the system across different faculty. The first two forms mainly serve to facilitate communication between student and advisor and can be adjusted to the needs of specific research groups. They should be made available to the committee for its annual meeting and kept on file by the advisor of the student. The third and final form is filled in by the committee and will be included in the student&#39;s file held at SAFS.

These annual review should consist of three steps (with a form each):

1. Written annual report and self-evaluation by the student
2. Student advisor meeting
  1. Discussion of that self-evaluation
  2. Evaluation of the student&#39;s progress by advisor
  3. Definition of specific goals for the next academic year
3. Committee meeting to revise or approve those goals
