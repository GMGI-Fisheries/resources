## Creating and printing a poster

#### 1. Create your poster using Google Slides. Set the dimensions to your desired dimensions for your finished poster.      
A typical poster may be 48in wide and 36in height.      
File > Page Setup > Custom 

#### 2. Convert your finished poster to a PDF
File > Download as... > PDF

#### 3. Submit to [UW Creative Commons](https://finance.uw.edu/c2/posters). Publications Services Bldg at 3900 7th Ave N.E., third floor.
You'll need:
- PDF of poster
- Budget #

Delivery options (to be specified when filling out submission form):      
- mailbox at SAFS
- specific room/office where you work
- get an email alert for you to pick up at their office

You can also make a note that you need the print done by a certain time/date. 

For example:         
I submitted my poster on a Wednesday evening at 4:30pm.         
I commented in the submission form that I needed it done by the next day (Thursday) 4pm at the latest.          
They were quick to respond to my submission. They emailed me and CC'ed the address that goes directly to the poster printers, and made sure that they knew of my time issue.          
I recieved an email the next day at 9:30am that my poster was ready for pickup. 

#### 4. Publish your final poster PDF to [FigShare](https://figshare.com).
