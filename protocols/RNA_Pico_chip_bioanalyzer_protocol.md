## RNA Pico Chip protocol

### (1) Prepare gel
1. Allow all reagents to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes before use.
2. Place 550 μl of RNA 6000 Pico gel matrix (red) into the top receptacle of a spin filter.
3. Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 1500 g (4000 rpm).
4. Aliquot 65 μl filtered gel into 0.5 ml RNase-free microcentrifuge tubes that are included in the kit. Store the aliquots at 4 °C and use them within one month of preparation.

### (2) Prepare Gel-Dye Mix
1. Protect the dye concentrate from light while bringing it to room temperature for 30 min.
2. Vortex RNA 6000 Pico dye concentrate (blue) for 10 seconds and spin down.
3. Add 1 μl of RNA 6000 Pico dye concentrate (blue) to a 65 μl aliquot of filtered gel (see previous section).
4. Allow the gel-dye mix to equilibrate to room temperature for 30 minutes before use. Protect the gel-dye mix from light during this time.

### (3) Loading the Gel-Dye Mix
1. Take a new RNA chip out of its sealed bag.
2. Place the chip on the chip priming station. Set the ratcheting stop latch to the top position (RNA position).
3. Pipette 9.0 μl of the gel-dye mix at the bottom of the well marked (G) and dispense the gel-dye mix.
4. Set the timer to 30 seconds, make sure that the plunger is positioned at 1 ml and then close the chip priming station. The lock of the latch will click when the chip priming station is closed correctly.
5. Press the plunger of the syringe down until it is held by the clip.
6. Wait for exactly 30 seconds and then release the plunger with the clip release mechanism.
7. Visually inspect that the plunger moves back at least to the 0.3 ml mark.
8. Wait for 5 seconds, then slowly pull back the plunger to the 1 ml position.
9. Open the chip priming station.
10. Pipette 9.0 μl of the gel-dye mix in each of the wells marked 'G' (two wells in the upper right hand corner)

### (4) Loading the Conditioning Solution, Marker, and Ladder
1. Pipette 9 μl of the RNA 6000 Pico conditioning solution (white) into the well marked CS.
2. Pipette 5 μL of the RNA 6000 Pico marker (green) into the well marked with a (ladder symbol) and each of the 11 sample wells.
3. Pipette 1 μl of the diluted RNA 6000 Pico ladde* (previsouly prepared - stored at -80C @ 13-3-3 / 13-4-2) into the well marked with the ladder symbol
4. Pipette 1 μl of each sample (Total RNA range = 50-5000 pg/uL) into each of the 11 sample wells.
5. Place the chip horizontally in the adapter of the IKA vortex mixer and make sure not to damage the buldge that fixes the chip during vortexing.
6. Vortex for 60 seconds at 2400 rpm.
