## Protocol

### Sample Preparation

**Step 0**: Set up materials

- Add ethanol to Buffer TD3 and TD4. The ethanol amount is specified on the container
- Preheat the heat block to 37ºC
- Label tubes for extractions
- Clean scalpel in 10% bleach solution

**Step 1**: Cut a tissue sample from the parrafin block

- Tare a scale with a piece of weigh paper
- Use a scalpel to cut and scoop out parrafin-embedded tissue
- Set the tissue on the weigh paper until there is 0.02 g of tissue

**Step 2**: Cut the block into smaller pieces and place them into a 2 mL round-bottomed processing tube

**Step 3**: Add 1 mL xylene to the sample. Vortex vigorously for 20 s, and incubate for 3 min on the benchtop

**Step 4**: Centrifuge at maximum speed for 3 minutes (but do not exceed 20,000 x g)

**Step 5**: Remove the supernatant by pipetting. Do not remove any of the pellet

**Step 6**: Add 1 mL of ethanol (96%-100%, purity grade p.a.) to the pellet, and mix by vortexing for 20 s.

**Step 7-8**: Repeat Steps 4-5

**Step 9**: Open the tube and incubate at room temperature for 10 minutes, or until all residual alcohol has evaporated

- An alternative is to incubate at 37ºC until all residual alcohol has evaporated.

**Step 10**: Resuspend the pellet in 180 µL Buffer TD1.

### Tissue Lysis and Incubation

**Step 11**: TBD

**Step 12**: TBD

**Step 13**: Carefully pipet lysates into new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge-safelock tubes

**Step 14**: Add 20 µL proteinkinase K, and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15s

**Step 15**: Incubate for 60 minutes at 56ºC using a heat block. Cover samples with foil to keep warm. Every ten minutes, vortex samples at maximum speed for one minute.

**Step 16**: Briefly centrifuge the microcentrifuge-safelock tube to remove drops from the inside of the lid

**Step 17**: Add 4 µL RNase A (100 mg/mL), mix by vortexing at maximum speed for 20 s, and incubate for 2 min at room temperature. This step is necessary to obtain RNA-free genomic DNA.

- This step can be skipped, but having RNA present in DNA samples can interfere with downstream enzyme reactions. Higher DNA yields are generally associated with isolation of pure DNA.

**Step 18**: Incubate for 60 min at 80ºC using a heat block. Cover samples with foil to keep warm. Every ten minutes, vortex samples at maximum speed for one minute.

**Step 19**: Repeat Step 16

**Step 20**: Add 200 µL Buffer TD2, and mix by pulse-vortexing for 15 s

**Step 21**: Add 200 µL ethanol (96-100%) to the sample, and mix thoroughly by vortexing

**Step 22**: Repeat Step 16. Some white precipitate may form in the tube, which is fine.

### DNA Isolation

**Step 23**: Pipet the sample, including any precipitate that may have formed, into the PAXgene DNA spin column placed in a 2 mL processing tube, and centrifuge for 1 min at 6000 x g. Plae the spin column in a new 2 mL procesing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

**Step 24**: Pipet 500 µL Buffer TD3 into the PAXgene DNA spin column, and centrifuge for 1 min at 6,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 mL processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

**Step 25**: Pipet 500 µL Buffer TD4 into the PAXgene DNA spin column, and centrifuge for 1 min at 6,000 x g. Place the spin column in a new 2 mL processing tube, and discard the old processing tube containing flow-through.

**Step 26**: Centrifuge for 3 min at maximum speed (but do not exceed 20,000 x g) to dry the membrane completely.

**Step 27**: Discard the processing tube containing flow-through. Place PAXgene DNA spin column in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and pipet 50 µL Buffer TD5 directly onto the PAXgene DNA spin column membrane. Incubate the spin column loaded with Buffer TD5 for five minutes at room temperature to increase DNA yield. Centrifuge for 1 min at maximum speed (but do not exceed 20,000 x g) to elute the DNA.

### Quantificiation

**Step 28**: Prepare the dsDNA Broad Range master solution using a 1:200 ratio of dsDNA Broad Range buffer to dye. For each sample and both standards, 200 µL of master solution is needed.

**Step 29**: For each standard's designated Qubit assay tube, add 10 µL of the correct standard and 190 µL of the master solution.

**Step 30**: For each sample's designated Qubit assay tube, add 1 µL of the sample and 199 µL of the master solution.

**Step 31**: Vortex all Qubit assay tube for 2-3 seconds at maximum speed. Incubate tubes at room temperature for two minutes.

**Step 32**: Use Qubit to quantify DNA yield in each sample tube.
